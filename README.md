# DAA-Connect4
# Project Overview
	Project Name
	Project Purpose
	Key goals

# Requirements
	Functional Requirements:
		Accept any valid Connect Four board as input.
		Output optimal moves to win the game using the Minimax Algorithm.
	Non-functional Requirements:
		Response time for move calculation should be reasonable.
# Algorithm:
	Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning:
	Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally.
	//Describe the Minimax Algorithm and how Alpha-Beta Pruning will be applied.
	//Discuss the expected advantages and improvements over a basic Minimax implementation.

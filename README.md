# DAA-Connect4
# Project Overview
Connect Four Game 

Course: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Overview: Implement a program to play Connect Four. The program should take as input the Connect Four board and output the moves to win the game.

Description: This project was coded in Python using the library Tkinter and implementing the Alpha Beta Pruning and Minmax Algorithms. 
The game is a traditional Connect Four game played by choosing the table size from various sizes offered in a dropbox and choosing between player vs player or player vs AI. 


# Requirements
	Functional Requirements:
		Accept any valid Connect Four board as input.
		Output optimal moves to win the game using the Minimax Algorithm.
	Non-functional Requirements:
		Response time for move calculation should be reasonable.
# Algorithm:
	Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning:
	Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally.
	//Describe the Minimax Algorithm and how Alpha-Beta Pruning will be applied.
	//Discuss the expected advantages and improvements over a basic Minimax implementation.
# Milestones:

# User Manuals:

To play the game from local host one can clone it directly from this gihub, 
	Execute the input_gui.py file, 
	Pick the table size and mode(player vs player or player vs AI)
	The game will continue until one of the players wins or runs out of time, 
	The game can end in a tie or using the buttons the game can be refreshed or exited.
If playing on web:
	Upon opening the main page pick the preferences and enjoy the game.

# Project Closure
	Outcomes:
	Despite the moves of the player, AI is able to identify and play the moves to win the game.
